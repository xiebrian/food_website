                <p>Hi! My name is Brian Xie, and I'm a software engineer at <a href='https://plaid.com/'>Plaid</a>. I graduated from MIT in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My primary academic interests include back-end software engineering, computer systems, and game theory.</p>
                <p>I'm a previous co-president of the <a href='http://poker.mit.edu'>MIT Poker Club</a>. I recently began playing Pot Limit Omaha in March 2020, and it has quickly become my game of choice and passion. I also love food, so I enjoy <a href='cookbook'>cooking</a> and visiting <a href='restaurants'>restaurants</a>. In IAP 2020, I did a beta-test of a pop-up restaurant in my suite, <a href='h31mp'>H31MP</a> -- check it out if you're interested!</p>
